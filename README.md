Less itching

> Every open source project begins with an itching

this is about a huge reaction on the current state of email processing, code production explosion and memory consumption inflation i had. it was an terrible itching.

if you want to code one of the most hip IDEs is fact based on a browser. it eats memory, contains millions of code lines, installs 330MB for an editor. same goes for a chat client. so when i looked over the alternatives for the chat client you had the choice between various GUI projects which more or less did not implement the desired features or where based on QT. only (gomuks)[https://github.com/tulir/gomuks] worked for me out of the box. incredible well even. while that one was based on console out. it's not even a GUI but a CUI. still it displays images (or thumbnails of that). it's written in (go)[https://go.dev/] and uses tcell.

i wondered if there is an email MUA with a similar concept. i did not find any. so i started my own.
